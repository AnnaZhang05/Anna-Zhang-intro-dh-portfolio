# Topic Modeling and Name Entity Recognition 

The readings on topic modeling and NER helped contextualize the technical terms we've learned in class so far. Although we've dove into the tools and practical applications of these approaches, these academic articles provided the mathematical explanations behind their uses. Although I was not able to fully comprehend most of the formuals and math theories behind them, particularly in the Mimno article, the graphs and calculations still served their purpose of convincing for the legitimacy of NER and topic modeling. 

The multiple cross references between Mimno, Blei, and Brett also showed the close connectedness amongst the early schoalrs of this field. Amongst the three styles of writing and their weights in the field, I appreciated both Mimno and Blei's scholarly explanations, but Brett's piece was the most clear and digestable for me. 

Brett's explanation and brief introduction to the method of LDA supporting topic modeling helped me place them in their perspective relevance to the applications we did in class. Although not able to fully comprehend all the LDA probabilistic models, the readings this week still captured and dissected the big picture ideas within NER and topic modeling.
