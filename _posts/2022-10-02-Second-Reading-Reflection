# On Edward Gibbon and Related:

Being a History and Classics student, the name Edward Gibbon is familiar to me. But I have yet to actually read his work before this semester, both in this class and my history seminar on early Christianity and its relationship with the imperial government. 

Because I'm assigned to read Gibbon's account and analysis of the early development of Christianity in Rome, I chose to read the same chapter for this class assignemnt to reduce my workload. 

After skimming over the table of contents and all the different summaries, I found Gibbon's framework mainly fixated on the individual emperors during their reign. Which might make sense to some people and most likely older generations' historians, for the "one man narrative" style of history was popular before the contemporary style emerged. 

I also found his organization in Volume II to be a bit confusing, for it began with early Christianity and its interactions with each emperor from Nero to Constantine; it eventually went back to the fixation on following emperors instead of the dialogues and themes about Christianity and its development. 

Another theme I noticed in Chapter XVI was Gibbon's projection and personal bias, in particular his position of placing the blames on Rome's decline onto Christianity. Biases are most of the time unavoidable, but Gibbon's attempt on neutrality through academic language and lengthy writing certainly made it harder for maybe non-Humanity focused readers to pick up on.
