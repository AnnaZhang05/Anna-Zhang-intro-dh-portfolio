# On Distant Reading
After a few weeks of learning more Python foundations and furthering my knowledge on DH, the readings this week provided an interesting point in my DH learning career. Since I've dabbled in a DH project in the past, I got a rough sense of the breadth and power of the humanities when combined of technology, but the readings on distant reading defined the terms in a more concrete sense. 

First, through the wikipedia page, the short history of the term affirmed my previous knowledge on DH's contemporary creation and development. Again, I think it must be funny to some of my more STEM oriented peers that we're reading articles from the past two decades, which would totally be old if not obsolete in those fields. But for the humanities, even for modern topics I remember aiming for writings published within the past 6 years as my target range for historical research. 

Back onto the topic of distant reading, the Kirsch article outlines example scales that could be used by technologies within English departments across universities: finding pattern through data within "7000" titles used to take a lifetime, but now would only take almost an insant. Tools like Google Ngram Viewer is an example of these digital tools that can process corpora of literary works in exponentially less amount of time compared to human close reading of said texts. 

Despite its numerous benefits and the new opportunities it unlocks, digital distant reading posed a question to humanists: is it required for humanities scholars to equipt themselves with programming knowledge then? For classically trained humanists that spend nearly a decade in higher education, adding another totally different technological requirement in their training seems difficult. However, the article points to collaboration as the answer to this question, as much of DH work is done with teams instead of traditional humanities research done mostly independently. This would be a new opportunity for scholars in different fields to come in contact with each other and expand their horizons in terms of the scale of their works and the combined scale of DH. 

With its powerful processing and other interdisplinary aspects, distant reading and DH as a whole can not only make humanist scholars research easier, but also unlock potentials never dreamed of before due to limited resources. But Kirsch also states digital tools' disadvantage in the way that it can manipulate information and data, but it can not synthesize new ideas or thoughts like sentient humans. 

Thus in a perfect world, humanists would combine their intellectual might with a team of digitally inclined scholars to advance their studies without bringing too much extra burden on either side of the equation.
