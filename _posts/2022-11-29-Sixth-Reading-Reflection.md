# Data Viz Principals and its Applications

In this week's readings/observations, I really enjoyed the emphasis being put onto the visual aspects of DH and data presentation as a whole. Having the training and background as an visual artist, the key aspects of data visualization made me realize how interdisplinary the application of DH in this field can be. Combining design principals such as aesthetics, clarity, and nuance, the visual components of data presentation can elevate the impact and effect of such data. 

I really liked the Cooley article for its endorsement of design and visual literacy, since I think it could be overlooked or even sacrificed sometimes as he said for the sake of the data themselves. With more emphasis and conversation in the field about better incorporations of visual presentations of data across multiple subjects in DH, topics would be able to spread much more easier with more impact for the general public as well. 

The psychological component of design and visual literacy is also fascinating, for how connected the human brain and eyes are. And I think to produce and deliver the most effective and beautiful kinds of design requires either the mastering of all the skills above, or more feasible, through collaborations. Even through something like data visualization, the interdisplinary and collaborative themes of DH still shine through. 

And of course the versitility of data visualization and design principals in general can be applied into broader topics within and outside of DH, which further proves their importance. Something interesting related to this that I've been working on is editorial magazine design through Melisma Magazine, the campus music journal. It'd be really interesting to see if I can incorporate some of the design principals with music data into my editorial deisng process.
