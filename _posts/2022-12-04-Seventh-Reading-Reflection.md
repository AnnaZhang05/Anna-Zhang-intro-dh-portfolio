## Gentle Intro to APIs

This introduction article on APIs and their applications within the DH field is really like its name, gentle, for the way it was structured nicely to ensure comprehension at every level before jumping straight in with the advanced technical vocabularies. 

Compared to my previous Programming Historian Lesson on APIs, I think I understood the concept and overall working theory of APIs better from this article. Althought that is not to say the hands-on experience didn't help, but I think my learning experience would've been better if I had read this article before diving straight into the API lesson. Since this unit on webscraping and APIs was scheduled later than my first lesson aroun early October, I wasn't able to benefit from that gentle introduction. 

My favorite part of the article is where it talks about APIs' application in museums and libraries, since my goal is to someday work within those spheres. And having used museum/library archive website and database before, API's intergration within these fields really shows the present and future of museums and libraries in the digital age. 

Although focusing on APIs specifically, this article affirmed my hopes of going into museum fields from tools and experiences I'll gain from DH and public humanities.
